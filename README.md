## Cloud computing w AWS
### SDLC stages
#### Risk factors with SDLC stages
##### Monitoring

### Key Advantages
- Ease of use
- Flexibility
- Robustness
- Cost

**SRE Introduction**
- What is the role of SRE?

-- Building and implemting change to a server
-- Build automation
-- Ensure reliability of a server


**Cloud Computing**
- What is Cloud Computing and the benefits of using it?

-- On demand resources (storage, power, location
-- Cloud Computing provides a wide range of technolgies that the user can access on a as-need basis
-- Rapid
-- Scalability
-- Saves cost


**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- What is AWS and the benefits of using it?

-- Cloud platform
-- Secure
-- Global reach

**SDLC and Stages of SDLC**
![image](https://www.goodfirms.co/glossary/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Software-Development-Life-Cycle.png)
- What is SDLC and what are the stages of it?

-- Methodology of creating software
-- Different phases of software development
Requirement analysis
Planning
Software design such as architectural design
Software development
Testing
Deployment

**SDLC Risk levels**
- What are the risk level at each stage of SDLC?

- Low: Requirement Analysis
- Medium: Planning/Design, Testing
- High: Development/Implementation, Deployment&Maintenance


**Advantages of AWS**

- Not as many ongoing costs (just the subscription fee, rather than maintanence, upgrades etc)
- Multi-cloud environment (ultra-hybrid)
- Nothing is lost if machine breaks --> all on Cloud

**Disadvangtages of AWS**

- Responsibilty of the data shifts --> data travels from local host to Cloud (how is responsible in between?) --> hybrid cloud for confidential data
- Hybrid Cloud infrastructure (some important data is kept in own data centre (own security, hard-drive), other data is publically available on AWS) --> e.g Banks

**On Premises**


**On Cloud**


**Multi-Cloud**
